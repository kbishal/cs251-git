\section*{Movie: GADAR}
 The issue the story tries to tackle is essential because from a historical standpoint, this really happened. The performance by Sunny Deol, Amisha Patel, and Amrish Puri is applaudable.
The film deserves the accolades it earned. The director Anil Sharma did a great job in creating different moods at appropriate times in the movie. I recommend it to everybody.
